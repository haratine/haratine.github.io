<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<br>Azure provides a how-to guide for how to create a Site-to-Site VPN in their technical documentation here: 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/">Product Directory</a><b> -> </b><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/?product=featured">Azure</a><b> -> </b><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/windows/tutorial-manage-vm">VPN Gateway</a><b> -> </b><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vpn-gateway/">Create a Site-to-Site.</a> 

<br>AWS provides a how-to guide for how to create a Site-to-Site VPN in their technical documentation here: 
<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/">AWS Documetation</a><b> -> </b><a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpn/?id=docs_gateway">VPN</a><b> -> </b><a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpn/latest/s2svpn/VPC_VPN.html">AWS Site-to-Site</a>

I was curious to see what this would look like, so I decided to set this up in my test lab and run through the process my self. I documented the steps below.


<h2>WHAT IS A SITE TO SITE VPN?</h2>
A site-to-site virtual private network (VPN) is a connection between two or more networks, such as a corporate network and a branch office network. A site-to-site VPN is a permanent connection designed to function as an encrypted link between offices (i.e., “sites”). This is typically set up as an IPsec network connection between networking equipment.

<br><b>GOOD TO KNOW</b>
<ol start="1">
<li>AWS supports certificates for Internet Key Exchange (IKE) authentication. To use certifiates for IKE Authenitcation, you must first create a subordinate Certificate Authority (CA). See <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2019/08/aws-site-to-site-vpn-now-supports-certificate-authentication/">here</a> for more details.</li>
</ol>


<h2>HOW DO YOU SET UP A SITE-TO-SITE VPN?</h2>

Now that we know the key benefits, the important terminology, we are better prepared to dive into the Site-to-Site VPN deployment process.

<b>DEPLOYMENT PROCESS OVERVIEW</b>
<ol start="1">
<li><b>Create</b> a Virtal Network Gateway in Azure.</li>
<li><b>Create</b> a Virtual Private Gateway in AWS.</li>
<li><b>Attach</b> the Virtual Private Gateway in AWS to a Virtual Private Cloud in AWS.</li>
<li><b>Create</b> a Customer Gateway in AWS for Azure.</li>
<li><b>Create</b> a VPN Connection in AWS.</li>
<li><b>Create</b> a Local Gateway in Azure.</li>
<li><b>Create</b> the Connection in Azure.</li>
<li><b>Update</b> the Routing Table in AWS.</li>
</ol>


<h2>CREATE A VIRTUAL NETWORK GATEWAY IN AZURE</h2>
<ol start="1">
<li>Sign in to the <a href="https://portal.azure.com/">Azure portal</a></li>
<li>Click on create resource and search for <b>Virtual Network Gateway.</b></li>
<li>Click <b>Create</b></li>
<li>Fill out fields.</li>
<br><img src="/assets/images/01awsAzure.jpeg" alt="01awsAzure">

<li><b>Tag</b> your resources appropriately.</li>
<br><img src="/assets/images/02awsAzure.jpeg" alt="02awsAzure">

<li><b>Review and create</b> the Virtual Private Gateway.</li>
<br><img src="/assets/images/03awsAzure.jpeg" alt="03awsAzure">
</ol>


<h2>CREATE A VIRTUAL PRIVATE GATEWAY IN AWS</h2>
<ol start="1">
<li>Sign in to the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/console/">AWS Console</a></li>
<li>Navigate to <b>Virtual Private Gateways</b> -> <b> Create Virtual Private Gateway</b></li>
<li>Name your Virtual Private Gateway and click <b>Create.</b></li>
<br><img src="/assets/images/04awsAzure.jpeg" alt="04awsAzure">
</ol>


<h2>CREATE A VIRTUAL PRIVATE GATEWAY IN AWS</h2>
<ol start="1">
<li>Click on your newly created Virtual Private Gateway and attached it to your Virtual Private Cloud.</li>
<br><img src="/assets/images/05awsAzure.jpeg" alt="05awsAzure">
</ol>

<h2>CREATE A CUSTOMER GATEWAY IN AWS FOR AZURE</h2>
<ol start="1">
<li>In your Virtual Private Cloud Dashbord, click Customer Gaweways.</li>
<li>Fill out the <b>Name</b>, <b>IP Address</b>, and choose your <b>Certificate ARN</b>.</li>
<br><img src="/assets/images/06awsAzure.jpeg" alt="06awsAzure">
</ol>

<h2>CREATE VPN CONNECTION IN AWS</h2>
<ol start="1">
<li>Select <b>Site-to-Site VPN Connections</b> from the left Menu Bar.</li>
<br><img src="/assets/images/07awsAzure.jpeg" alt="07awsAzure">
<li>Enter the details, alpong with the Virtual Private Gateway and Customer Gateway created earlier. In this example, I am using the static routing so I added the CIDR block from my Azure VNET. Leave all other fields default.</li>
<br><img src="/assets/images/08awsAzure.jpeg" alt="08awsAzure">

<li><b>Download</b> the configuration file as follows:</li>
<br><img src="/assets/images/09awsAzure.jpg" alt="09awsAzure">
</ol>

<h2>CREATE A LOCAL GATEWAY IN AZURE</h2>
<ol start="1">
<li>Back in the Azure portal, search for <b>Local Network Gateway</b> and click <b>Create</b></li>
<br><img src="/assets/images/00awsAzure.jpg" alt="00awsAzure">   
<li>Fill out the fields. Use the IP Address under <b>Outside IP Adresses</b> -> <b>Virtual Private Gateway</b></li>
<br><img src="/assets/images/11awsAzure.jpeg" alt="11awsAzure">
</ol>

<h2>CREATE A CONNECTION IN AZURE</h2>
<ol start="1">
<li>In the Azure portal, search for <b>Connection</b> and click <b>Create</b></li>
<li>Select the appropriate <b>Connection Type</b>, <b>Subscription</b>, <b>Resource Group</b>, and <b>Location</b> and click <b>OK.</b></li>
<li>Select the <b>Virtual Network Gateway</b> and <b>Local Network Gatewway</b> created earlier and enter the <b>PSK</b> from the configuration file. Set the connection name</li>
<br><img src="/assets/images/13awsAzure.jpeg" alt="13awsAzure">
<li>After the deployment succeeds, the tunnel should be established. To verify this, go to the connection and check the status.</li>
<li>Verify the status of the tunnel in the AWS Console:</li>
<br><img src="/assets/images/14awsAzure.jpg" alt="14awsAzure">
</ol>

<h2>UPDATE THE TOURING TABLE IN AWS</h2>
<ol start="1"> 
<li>Search for <b>Route table</b> in your AWS Console.</li>
<li>Edit the routing table to include the CIDR block from your Azure Virtual Private Gateway, this will ensure any traffic destined for the Azure network will route through the Virtual Private Gatewaye rather than going out of the internet gateway.</li>
