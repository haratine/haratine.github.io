<p>Hello and welcome to my blog! I would like to take a moment to say a few things and fill up my about page. In the words of Irongeek (and yes, fuzzysecurity too), 
	 "I don't know everything - I'm just a geek with time on my hands‚Äù....however, throughout my infosec journery I have developed some skills and I intend to share whatever I have learned here. A couple of things you can expect to find here are: walkthroughs, scripts, and other interesting links. 


<br>Lastly, please note (1) this site is under permanent construction (2) the content is for educational purposes only, and (3) if you have any issues with the ontent please feel free to email me.
